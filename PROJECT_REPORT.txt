users identify potential health conditions based on their symptoms. The 
application is designed to:
• Provide quick symptom-based health assessments
• Recommend appropriate medical specialists
• Offer relevant health tips and advice
• Manage medication reminders
• Maintain comprehensive health records

2.2 TARGET AUDIENCE
• General public seeking preliminary health guidance
• Healthcare professionals for quick reference
• Patients managing chronic conditions
• Individuals requiring medication management

5. DATABASE DESIGN
================================================================================

The application uses a hybrid storage approach with MongoDB as the primary 
database and JSON files as a fallback mechanism. This ensures data persistence 
even when MongoDB is unavailable.

COLLECTIONS:
• patient_records: Stores user symptom data and diagnoses
• medication_reminders: Manages medication schedules
• search_logs: Tracks user search patterns
• email_logs: Records email notification history

DATA MIGRATION:
Successfully migrated 6 documents from local JSON storage to MongoDB, 
including 4 patient records and 2 search logs.

================================================================================
6. USER INTERFACE
================================================================================

The user interface is built using Bootstrap framework, providing:
• Responsive design for mobile and desktop
• Intuitive symptom selection interface
• Clear results presentation
• Easy navigation between features
• Professional medical theme
• Data visualization for MongoDB and local storage

================================================================================
7. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
